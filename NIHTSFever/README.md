# NIHTS Fever

A random smattering of tools focused on analysis of images from the
Near Infrared High Throughput Spectrograph (NIHTS) at the Lowell
Discovery Telescope (LDT).

Overall status of this: I'm just basically hardcoding things for now
to do some simple arc on-off subtractions.

Eventually this will be more useful.
