# Eat At Joes

Quick and dirty monitoring of joe-related things (stages, OMS, etc.)

### Dear God Why

We just need way more monitoring of the behavior of things, it's still
guesswork on the best of days with what we have presently (in Nov. 2019).

This will also be the place that joe command processors are both
reverse engineered and prototyped, for further use in joe "helpers" or
outright replacements.
