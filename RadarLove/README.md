### Additional Shapefiles

I'm using https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/roads/ for
road information, explicitly parsed to only get a subset of road types/categories.

See the ```parseRoads``` function for more details but it's pretty simple using the attributes
in the above mentioned shapefile.
