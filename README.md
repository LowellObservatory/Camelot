'Tis a silly place. Repository for one offs and toy models initially exploring random topics.

## CentroidMcCentroidface

Created to quickly assess centroid/tracking quality for the Lowell 31" at Anderson Mesa.

It turned out that when the sidereal tracking was on, we were getting a big periodic error
associated with a belt in the RA drive that needed replacing.  This is the code that 
quickly chugged thru the data to figure that out.

## GOESMcGOESface

Prototype for grabbing the current GOES-16 data and manipulating it ourselves for display,
so we don't have to depend on anything else for the DCT & NightWatch.
